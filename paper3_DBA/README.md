## üìå Overview

This work proposes a novel framework for reliability prediction in Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) platforms. It integrates a **hybrid multi-layer graph attention mechanism** with a **self-attention module** to capture both structural dependencies and global contextual features across blockchain services.
